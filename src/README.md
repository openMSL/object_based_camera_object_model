# *src* Folder

The src folder contains the actual source code of the model.
In this template this folder has everything needed to build a sensor model FMU, based on the [OSI Sensor Model Packaging](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging).
The hello world example is based on the [OSMPDummySensor](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging/tree/master/examples/OSMPDummySensor) and contains the following files:

| File                      | Description                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CMakeLists.txt            | Contains the cmake instructions to build and package the model.                                                          |
| HelloWorldSensor.cpp/.h:  | These files contain the actual model source code.                                                                        |
| modelDescription.in.xml   | Contains the input for the modelDescription.xml file packaged with every FMU. The actual xml file is generated by cmake. |
